	 <h2 id="v1"> Vision Statement</h2>
	 <p> I, Tahjae Quarrie, looking forward to see myself achieving all set objectives/ Goals in the future. My main aim is to always make I,my family and friends proud of what i'm persuing, however I'd like to become a certified web designer at the highest level possible, i'm thankful to the lord for where i'm at in life because alot of perosns never got the opportunity or live to reach where i'm at right now, also i'm also grateful for my friends who always push me to my full potential to do my best at anything, i pray God guide us and keep us safe from anyone or anything that tries to hinder us from pursuing excellence.</P>
	 <br>
	 <h3> Mission Statement </h3>
	 <p> Growing up as a young adult, I'm taking things step by step until i've achieved everything i have set. Presntly, i'm attending the University of Technology, in the faculty of computing and information technology, currently a second year student. Its not an easy road, alot of person describe this field as one of the most technical and difficult route to take,however i have a passion for information technology since High School so why not? thus, for me this is one of the most important field because by the day goes by techology increases, meaning withing the next 5 years humans are going to be more intertwined in learning how to live with technology, in addition, more programmers, web designers, computer technician, etc are going to be needed. With God, i'm looking foward to complete this course of study, with straight A profile.   </p>
