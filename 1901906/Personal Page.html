	   <a name="Optimism" href=""> Optimism </a>
	   <p> Optimism can be defined as,the quality of being full of hope and emphasizing the good parts of a situation, or a belief that something good will happen. </p>
	   <p> Optimism should be a trait that become common, because in todays society majority of the teenagers are fighting depression because of what they're facing in there lives. when a person can keep a positive mind, they can overcome anything that stands in thier path.Optimism has been proven to improve the immune system, prevent chronic disease, and help people cope with unfortunate news. Gratitude is associated with optimism and has been determined that grateful people are happier, receive more social support, are less stressed, and are less depressed. Recent research indicates that optimists and pessimists approach problems differently, and their ability to cope successfully with adversity differs as a result.</p>
       <p> Optimism does not mean engaging in wishful or fantastic thinking. It’s a way of looking at the world that gives more agency to the optimist as being at least partly responsible when life is going well. Optimists have healthier outlooks and tend to live longer than their more pessimistic counterparts; they also are less susceptible to the negative effects of illness, fatigue, and depression. However, an unrealistic belief that a person’s future will be full of only positive events can lead them to take unnecessary risks, particularly with their health and finances.</P>
       <p> However,Evidence suggests that men and women share similar levels of optimism, but there are gender differences in what they are optimistic about. Men, for example, have been found to hold more optimistic views about the economic future. During economic downturns, however, the gender difference disappears.</P>

	   <p>Tahjae never really like showing his emotions even though he is a very emotional person. In jamaica, for a guy to show his emotions to others or even in public, majority of jamaicans are going to say its a sign of weakness but Tahjae is not a person who really cares what people think of him. thats one of the main reason why he doesn't show emotions.</p>
	   <p>Secondly, humans like to belittle you or used you when they know your weakness, rather than try to not make you feel a certain type of way towards different things or situations.A vast majority of teenagers are now facing depression because of their emotions/feelings therefore they tend to give in and lower their guards among people who careless about people feelings thus, aproximaetly 67.8% of jamaicans dont know how to treat persons when it comes on to different situations, so why show emotions?  </p>
	   <p>In addition, when it comes on to relationship, some perons dont know the true meaning or what comes with a relationship. I strongly believe love can be defined as a feeling a person encounter when being in a relationship. loves comes with alot of pain and emotions towards different situation, however Tahjae does not search for love or search for to beloved, beacuse he knows the concequences that love came with when things arent going in the right direction.</p>

	  <a name="Dislikes" href=""> Dislikes </a>
	  <p> There are quite a number of things Tahjae dislike. Firstly, he dislike failure and accept failure. therefore, when he failed to be successful in any task or objectives he sets aside, at one point he felt lost or felt like giving up but then he remember that failure is a lesson.</p>
	  <p> secondly, he dislike disloyalty, its hard to be loyal  and genuine to someone  that does not value you or dont count you. disloyalty can get you killed, thats one of the main reason why Tahjae dislike disloyalty. finally he also hated the fact that critisim is a major act in the world done by humans, critism can cause peer pressure and depression. However, it is unfair that persons have a say in everything they see you do.</p>

	  <p> As a juviniel growing up, Tahjae always wanted to become a professional football player. However, who really spark his interest in loving the sport is a professional football player by the name of Ronaldhino.
