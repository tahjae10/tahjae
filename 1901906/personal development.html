	  <h2 align="center"> Some key features that makes me a better person</h2>
	  
	  <h3> A psositive mindset</h3>
	  <p> Keeping a positive mindset is easy for me, because of the persons i surrended myself with and because of my personality. I may be the funniest or one of the funniest/happiest human a person could ever meet, i always try to put a smile on everyone face because nobody know what a person is going through when they're alone. On keeping a positive mindset, i also try to segregate myself from anyone or anything with bad energy and a nasty mind. However, from practising since the past few year on keeping my mind right, i've never been depressed or have any mental illnesses.  </p>
	  
	  <h3> Determination </h3>
	  <p> Determination is one of the main influences/key to success. My grandma always told me "if yuh waa gud, uh nose affi run" meaning if you want to be sucessfull, you have to make sacrifices, therefore anything i want in life i always told myself that the only thing can stop me from not achieving it is death, but with God everything is possible, i alwasy put God first in everything i do. Determination and dedication put me where i am in life rn, everyday i have to give praises to God beacuse if it wasnt him also I'd lost myself couple years ago.  </p>
	  
	  <h3> Respectfulness</h3>
	  <p> Respect brings you a far way in life, i was born in respect , when it comes on to respect my family put that first. They strongly believe that everyone should be respected weather you're a baby or you're an elder, when respect due you should get it. Furthermore, being respectful teach persons that you value yourself and it also elighten them about the kind of household you were raised in. Finally, it dont cost a dollar to be respectful to someone.  </p>

	  <p> So basically the Keirsey test was kinda accurate in general, you should be more familiar with your personality before judging others, however, i'm not judegemental when it come on to others, i rather stay silent than be judgemental. </P>
